### 🌟 My Journey So Far

I'm an AI engineer who builds systems with LLMs, multi-agent frameworks, and machine learning. My path took me from Kerala to Singapore to the UK—starting as an application developer at Oracle, then realizing my real interest was in what AI could do with data. That led me to pursue my Master's in Computing (AI) from the National University of Singapore, and since then I've been building LLM-powered chatbots, translation workflows, RAG systems, and automation tools. I'm happiest when I'm solving a tricky technical problem or experimenting with new frameworks.

### 🌟 My Journey So Far

I love blending code, creativity, and curiosity to build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My journey has taken me from Kerala to Singapore to the UK—along the way, I earned my Masters in Computing (AI) from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and built LLM-powered chatbots, predictive models, and data-driven apps for finance, EdTech, and more. I’m happiest when experimenting with new tech, geeking out over ML papers, or helping others learn.

- 🧠 Specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- 🛠️ Python, LLMs, LangChain, FastAPI, React, Cloud, and more
- 🚢 Building, breaking, and learning—one project at a time
- ✨ Always up for a chat about tech, travel, or your next big idea!
- 🔧 Currently freelancing, working on AI/ML projects that leverage cutting-edge AI techniques.
- 🌍 Based in the UK 🇬🇧 (but always online 🌐)



### 🌱 What I’m Into Now

- LLMs, agentic AI, RAG, and the latest in GenAI

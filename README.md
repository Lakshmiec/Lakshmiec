### 🌟 My Journey So Far

I'm an AI engineer who builds systems with LLMs, multi-agent frameworks, and machine learning. My path took me from Kerala to Singapore to the UK—starting as an application developer at Oracle, then realizing my real interest was in what AI could do with data. That led me to pursue my Master's in Computing (AI) from the National University of Singapore, and since then I've been building LLM-powered chatbots, translation workflows, RAG systems, and automation tools. I'm happiest when I'm solving a tricky technical problem or experimenting with new frameworks.

- 🎓 MSc in Computing (Artificial Intelligence), National University of Singapore (NUS)
- AI Engineer specializing in LLMs, NLP & Multi-Agent Systems
- Python, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, FastAPI, React, Docker, AWS
- Currently freelancing and actively looking for AI engineering roles
- Based in London, UK 🇬🇧




### What I’m Into Now .....

- LLMs, agentic AI, RAG, and the latest in GenAI
- Cloud technologies (AWS, GCP, Azure) & DevOps
- Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) & always learning new skills
- Open-source AI projects and hackathons
- Making ML more accessible to everyone


### A Few Things About Me

- Lived and worked in three countries: India → Singapore → UK
- My transition from Oracle developer to AI engineer taught me that it's never too late to pivot toward what excites you
- I learn best by doing, which explains why I have so many side projects
